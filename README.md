# Ensemble-Methods----Stacking-using-Python

## Stacking
This is similar to Bagging But here we can use multiple models instead of using same model. which means in bagging different samples are taken and given to different Decision Tree models simultaneously, instead in stacking these different samples are given to different models like 1 sample to decision tree, one model to svm and so on.
 
 Atlast combine all the models outputs.
